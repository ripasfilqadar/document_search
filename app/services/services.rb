# Service Object implements the userâ€™s interactions with the application.
# When to use
#   - Business logic is duplicated among controllers or jobs
#   - Business logic is reaching across multiple models
#   - Model or controller gets too fat or too complex
#   - Action is additional to the model, such as notifying
#   - Calling external service
#
# Basic Principles
#   - Serves one specific purpose (Single Responsibility Principle)
#   - A service can act as a wrapper, e.g. calling multiple services. Example: PurchaseService::Create
#
# Conventions
# Strict:
#   - Namespace with domain name
#   - use the facade module to call
#   - Use verb as class name
#   - Have only one public method
#     Remember that it should only serves one specific purpose. If one public method is not sufficient, maybe your service is doing too much?
#   - extend the Service::Base class
